    "Prior to loading the data, we identify and categorize columns with string data types in the dataset. Additionally, it selects columns from the 'V' category, focusing on those that exhibit meaningful relationships with the target variable as revealed through correlation-based exploratory data analysis (EDA). By doing so, the code aims to streamline the dataset to include only the most relevant 'V' columns, optimizing computational efficiency and model performance during subsequent analysis and modeling phases."

    "After looking at the dataset, we realise that the 'D Columns' represent time intervals relative to a specific past reference point. Our objective is to remove time dependence and convert these 'D Columns' into values that correspond to moments in the past rather than future time intervals. This adjustment ensures that the 'D Columns' no longer exhibit an increasing trend over time because we have normalized it against the effects of time. We achieve this transformation using the formula `D15n = Transaction_Day - D15`, where 'Transaction_Day' is calculated as 'TransactionDT' divided by the number of seconds in a day (24 hours * 60 minutes * 60 seconds). Subsequently, we invert the result by multiplying it by -1."

If the addition of a feature leads to an increase in AUC, we retain that feature; otherwise, we eliminate it from consideration. This iterative process helps us identify and incorporate features that enhance model performance while disregarding those that do not contribute positively. The below features are the features that we have thought of that increases the AUC score."
